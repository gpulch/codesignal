iterative function that takes a number n 
and returns the number at index n in the fibonacci sequence

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it:

the 2 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+1),
the 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2),
the 5 is (2+3),
and so on!
Example: the next number in the sequence above is 21+34 = 55

Here is a longer list:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 
89.144.233.377.610.987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 
6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368, 75025, 
121393, 196418, 317811, 514229, ...
